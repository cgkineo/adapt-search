The search extension displays in the Adapt 'drawer', either as a single item or with other items - such as the [resources plugin](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-resources).

## Installation
To install this extension using the Adapt CLI, run `adapt install adapt-search`

## Settings Overview
The search extension's main configuration should be added to *course.json*. Additional configuration of search 'keywords' may be included on contentObjects, articles, blocks and components.

## General Attributes

Search field text box 'placeholder' text, defaults to `""`.

### description (string):
Extension description, defaults to `"Type in search words"`.

### \_drawerOrder (number):
Determines the order in which this extension appears as a drawer item. You only need to set this if your course has more than one extension that appears in the drawer (e.g. [glossary](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-glossary), [resources](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-resources)) and you want to control the order in which they are listed when the drawer is opened.

### noResultsMessage (string):
Text displayed when no results are found, defaults to `"Sorry, no results were found"`.

### awaitingResultsMessage (string):

### \_previewWords (integer):
The number of words taken from either side of the matching word. Defaults to `15`.

### \_previewCharacters (integer):
If the number of `_previewWords` cannot be found then use `x` number of characters. Defaults to `30`.

## Item Attributes
The attributes listed below are used in *contentObject.json*, *articles.json*, *blocks.json* and *components.json* to configure **Search Items**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-search/blob/master/example.json).

### \_search (object): 
Container object for the `keywords` setting

### title (string):

### keywords (array): 
A list of search keywords/phrases to be associated with the contentObject/article/block/component. Each item in the array must be a string.
**NOTE**: Keywords are exported with the `grunt translate:export` command. When localising content, use a process that ensures translated keywords are found in the actual translated course content.
